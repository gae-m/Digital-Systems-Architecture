Projects of digital circuits in VHDL for the academic course of Digital Systems Architecture (ASDi).

The [documentation](https://github.com/gae-m/Digital-Systems-Architecture/blob/main/Documentation_ITA.pdf) is in Italian (because the course was in Italian and I don't have time to translate it in English, sorry).
